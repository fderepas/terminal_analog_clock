An analog clock in the terminal

# Install
Once [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) is installed, type in the terminal:
```
cargo build --release
```
or just type ```make``` if you have [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed.

This creates the ```target/release/tag``` executable you can put anywhere.
